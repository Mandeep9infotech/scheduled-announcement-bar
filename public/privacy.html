<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Effective Date: February 2026</p>

<p>Scheduled Announcement Bar ("the App") is developed and operated by Appiesoft Web Solutions. This Privacy Policy describes how information is collected, used, and protected when merchants install and use the App.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>The App does not collect, store, or process personal data of customers.</p>

<p>The App may access the following merchant store data strictly for functionality purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shop information required for authentication</li>
  <li>Metafields used to store announcement bar configurations</li>
</ul>

<p>No payment information, customer personal data, or sensitive information is collected or stored by the App.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

<p>Information accessed by the App is used solely to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow merchants to create, schedule, and manage announcement bars</li>
  <li>Display announcement content on the storefront</li>
</ul>

<p>The App does not use store data for advertising, marketing, analytics resale, or profiling.</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

<p>All announcement data is stored within the merchant’s Shopify store using Shopify metafields. The App does not maintain external databases containing merchant or customer personal information.</p>

<p>Reasonable administrative and technical safeguards are implemented to protect any accessed store data.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

<p>The App does not sell, trade, rent, or share merchant or customer data with third parties.</p>

<p>No third-party services are used to process or analyze merchant data beyond Shopify’s infrastructure.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

<p>The App retains access to store metafields only while the App is installed. Upon uninstallation, the App no longer accesses merchant data.</p>

<h2>6. Merchant Rights</h2>

<p>Merchants may uninstall the App at any time to revoke access to store data.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be reflected on this page with a revised effective date.</p>
